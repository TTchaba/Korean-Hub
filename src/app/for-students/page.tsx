There's no age cutoff or entry test; the teacher will help place you at the right level after registration.",

  {
    title: "How lessons work",
    body: "Lessons are live and online, one hour long, twice a week, for both the individual and group formats. You'll join by video call at the time agreed with your teacher — no pre-recorded videos, no self-paced modules to work through alone.",
  },
  {
    title: "What to expect",
    body: "Expect a conversational, teacher-led class rather than a rigid curriculum. Your teacher will adapt pace and material to your level and goals, whether that's everyday conversation, travel, exam preparation, or something more specific.",
  },
  {
    title: "How online lessons happen",
    body: "You'll need a stable internet connection and a device with a camera and microphone. Your teacher will share the video call link and any materials directly with you once your schedule is confirmed.",
  },
  {
    title: "The registration process",
    body: "Registration happens directly on this website — choose a lesson type and fill in a short form with your details and goals. It's a request, not an instant booking, and there's no account to create or password to remember.",

  {
    title: "Schedule confirmation",
    body: `After you register, ${koreanHubConfig.brand.name} will contact you directly — by email or phone — to talk through your goals and agree on the specific days and times for your lessons. This step is handled personally, not automatically.`,

  {
    title: "What happens after you register",
    body: "You'll see a confirmation on-screen once your request has been received, and Korean Hub will reach out shortly after. There's no dashboard to check or account to log into — everything from here happens by direct contact.",
